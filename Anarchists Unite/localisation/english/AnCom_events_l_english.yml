 anarchist_germany.1.t: "Heydrich's Choices..."
 anarchist_germany.1.desc: "Heydrich has requested the appointment of Heinrich Müller to the position of Gestapo Director of Operations. While his competency is not in dought, his loyalties leave something to be desired. Müller is not currently a member of the party, and before our rise to power was an ardent oponent to the NSDAP, having refered to the Führer as 'an immigrant unemployed house painter' and 'an Austrian draft-dodger'. Furthermore his actions to prevent the party's rise were just as hostile as his actions agains the Communists while he was in the role of the Munich Political Police Department. Can we allow such an ardent critic to head our most important police division?"
 anarchist_germany.1.a: "We should trust Heydrich's Judgement"
 anarchist_germany.1.b: "Fire this traitor immediately!"
 anarchist_germany.2.t: "Chaos in the Gestapo"
 anarchist_germany.2.desc: "With the sudden termination of Müller the Gestapo has been thrown into chaos. Several operations designed to curtail various opposition movements have completely fallen through and an upsurge in the criminal underground has allowed these dangerous political movements to flourish. We no longer know who our enemies are, and tensions are rising all accross the Fatherland..."
 anarchist_germany.2.a: "Scheiße!"
 anarchist_germany.2.b: "All according to plan..."
 anarchist_germany.3.t: "The Edelweiss Pirates"
 anarchist_germany.3.desc: "Just as our movement was begining to slow to a crawl, curious reports from our operatives began trickling in. Bands of teenagers, dissafected with the Nazi regime and the Hitler Youth, have been defecting and staging actions of their own to combat fascism. While it would be immoral for us to fully arm and send these children in any capacity, they seem unwilling to back down, and entirely determined to spread propaganda and perform small acts of vandalism regardless of what we or the Gestapo think. Providing them shelter and safe harbor is the least we can do, and the skills they have gained from the Hitler Youth have given them a natural skill at trekking accross the German countryside. In the words of a gestapo agent whos report we were able to intercept:\n\"They are everywhere; there are more of them than there are Hitler Youth... They beat up the patrols... They never take no for an answer.\""
 anarchist_germany.3.a: "Eternal War on the Hitler Youth!"
 anarchist_germany.4.t: "The Final Conflict"
 anarchist_germany.4.desc: "The time has come commrades. We have martialled all our effort. The iron jaws of the fascists howl over the death of their putrid fuhrer. They crave our blood, but our guns are ready. From field, town, and hill the oppressed have risen to join our struggle. There is no turning back, either we die or birth a new world from the corpses of the fascists dead. We cary the hope of a bright future in our hearts, and now must struggle to the last to see it come. Take heart commrade, for we face the final battle."
 anarchist_germany.4.a: "Auf Die Barrikaden!"

Numerous political enemies have been imprisoned accross the Urals and Siberia. If we can send operatives to stage a revolt they may be a potent ally in the comming civil war.

 anarchist_spain.1.desc: "The so called \"Anarchists\" of Spain have offered a curious proposal. Noting the tensions with Germany, they have offered to garrison parts of Southern France to protect the civilians in the event of a successful German invasion. Our generals are optimistic that the Germans have no chance in breaching our defenses, but perhaps we can get something out of this arragement. After all, they only get the territory if we lose."

Citing an intention to assist us in our war with Germany, they have offerec to give us some naval support and docking rights. While having an ally on the continent would help extend our reach into the Medeteranian, they are requesting we give them control of Gibraltar. This might be a worth while offer if they were to also join the war, but they are requesting time to get involved..."
